# golang-microservice-play
Some repository for toying around with Golang microservices.

I might add some microservice(s) to process simple CRUD operations using PostgreSQL hosted in AWS (free tier, of course!). I'm thinking about mapping some simple entities that belong to a tabletop RPG system I play with my friends called Mighty Blade, which includes: races, classes and skills (for now). Races have skills and classes also have skills. That's enough for a humble start.
