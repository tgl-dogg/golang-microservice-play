# Golang Microservice Play
Some repository for toying around with Golang microservices.

I might add some microservice(s) to process simple CRUD operations using PostgreSQL hosted in AWS (free tier, of course!). I'm thinking about mapping some simple entities that belong to a tabletop RPG system I play with my friends called Mighty Blade, which includes: races, classes and skills (for now). Races have skills and classes also have skills. Skills have all sort of characteristics and that's where the things start to get interesting. 

More about Mighty Blade [here](https://editorarunas.com.br/mightyblade/) and [here](https://coisinhaverde.com.br/jogos/portfolio/mighty-blade-rpg/) (only available in Portuguese as far as I know).  
**Disclaimer**: I do not own or claim to own or have any filiation with Mighty Blade or any of it's creators or owners. I'm just a hobby player.
